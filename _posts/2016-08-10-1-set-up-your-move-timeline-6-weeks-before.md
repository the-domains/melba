Summertime is a popular time for people to move. With school out for summer and college graduation sending recent grads off to their newfound jobs, it's no wonder many Americans will choose the summer for their big move.

It is estimated in a given year, 43 million Americans will relocate and nearly [half of those moves occur in the summer][0], between Memorial Day and Labor Day.

Whether you're moving across the street or across the country, moving can be a stressful time for many people.

Here are eight tips to make your impending move a little bit easier to manage:

## 1\. Set up your move timeline: 6 weeks before.

As soon as you sign the papers on your new place and set a date to take possession, you should start thinking about how you will execute the move.

How soon will you start packing? When will you set up the utilities for your new place? How long is it going to take to get fully moved in? If you're moving to a furnished place, plan on a full day to move everything in and if you're moving to an unfurnished place, plan to stretch out your move over the course of two or more days, depending on how much stuff you have to move.

If possible, try to organize a "soft move" a day or two before the big move.

## 2\. Take inventory of your stuff: 6 weeks before.

Moving is often a great opportunity to go through your personal items and discard anything no longer of value to you, as well as a great excuse to get new things.

Make a list of everything important you own and determine if you will take them with you, store them elsewhere or donate/discard them. You should also make a list of everything you will need to buy (furniture, kitchen appliances, etc).

Many stores (i.e. Target, IKEA, Bed Bath & Beyond, etc.) have an online feature that will let you create shopping lists and registries. This is a great way to keep a running list of what you will need and what has already been purchased. Plus, this can help you stay organized throughout the move and help you sort out what are necessary purchases versus things that can be purchased on a future date.

## 3\. Assemble your moving crew: 4 weeks before.

If you're lucky enough to be moving across town or somewhere you already have some friends and family, you can probably save yourself the expense of hiring a team of movers. Kindly ask everyone you know who would likely be able to help you move if they are available to help.

Try to find some people who can lift heavy furniture and some who would be willing to help move smaller items. Expect to reward your crew with cash (however much is up to you) or with dinner and drinks and return the favor if possible.

## 4\. Create a packing system: 2 weeks before.

Packing is always the part of moving that is a true pain. It will be in your best interest to be as organized as possible while packing to avoid confusion on move-in day, especially if you will have boxes going to storage or other places that are not your new house.

So, if you're tempted to quickly throw everything into random boxes, don't.
